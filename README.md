trello-combinator
=================

This is just a simple javascript class that downloads the first google drive attachment off of a bunch of trello cards and combines them into a single document. Useful for writing and keeping snippets
of stories in separate google docs, then recombine them all.

It's not really ready to go for other projects. Feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like help customizing it for your project.
